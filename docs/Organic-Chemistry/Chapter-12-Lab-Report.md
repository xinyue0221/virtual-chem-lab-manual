## **1. Have Your Molecule Name Here**

- **Your Ethanol Name**:  
  *(e.g., “FirstnameLastname Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)”)*
- **Your Acetone Name**:  
  *(e.g., “FirstnameLastname Acetone (C₃H₆O)”)*

  *(e.g., “FirstnameLastname Styrene (C₈H₈)”)*

!!! tip
    Remember to incorporate **your name** and the **molecule formula** to personalize each molecule’s name.

## **2. Building the Molecule in QOOL**

1. **Construction Steps**  
   Provide a **concise, step-by-step** description (2–3 sentences per molecule) of how you built each structure in **QOOL**.  
   - **Ethanol**: How you connected the carbons, added hydrogens, and placed the hydroxyl group.  
   - **Acetone**: How you formed the carbonyl (C=O) group and attached methyl groups.  
   - **Styrene**: How you created the benzene ring, attached the vinyl group, etc.

2. **Optimize the Geometry**  
   - Before running any calculations, **optimize** the molecular geometry to minimize energy and achieve a realistic conformation.  
   - Briefly note any key observations during optimization (e.g., changes in bond angles, reorganization of substituents).

## **3. Setting Up the IR Spectrum Calculation**

1. **Calculation Setup**  
   - Describe the **calculation type** chosen (e.g., “Vibrational Frequencies” or “Optimize + Vib Freq”).  
   - Specify the **method** (e.g., B3LYP, ωB97X-D, PBE0) and **basis set** (e.g., 6-31G(d), 6-311+G(d,p)) you selected.  
   - Include any **charge** or **multiplicity** settings (usually 0 charge, singlet multiplicity for neutral organic molecules).

2. **Screenshot of Your Settings**  
   - Provide a screenshot of the **QOOL input parameters** showing method, basis set, and any other options.

## **5. Analyzing the IR Spectrum**

Once the calculations are complete:

1. **Access the Results**  
   - Download or view the **IR spectrum** from QOOL for each molecule.

2. **Identify Absorption Peaks**  
   - Note **significant peaks** (in cm⁻¹) that appear in the IR spectrum.  
   - Pay special attention to peaks that indicate O–H, C=O, aromatic C–H, etc.

3. **Assign Peaks to Functional Groups**  
   - Consult IR reference charts (or textbook tables) to **assign vibrations** to specific peaks.  
   - Discuss how you confirmed each assignment.

4. **Interpret the Spectrum**  
   - Summarize how each **functional group** is represented in the IR data (e.g., broad O–H band, sharp C=O stretch).  
   - Consider any **effects** (e.g., hydrogen bonding, conjugation, ring systems, etc.) that might shift or broaden the peaks.

**Upload Your IR Spectrum Table Here**  
- **Ethanol**:  
  *(Insert IR spectrum table or screenshot with labeled peaks.)*
- **Acetone**:  
  *(Insert IR spectrum table or screenshot with labeled peaks.)*
- **Styrene**:  
  *(Insert IR spectrum table or screenshot with labeled peaks.)*

## **6. Data Recording**

Provide **tables** documenting the observed peaks and their corresponding functional groups for each molecule. Add or remove rows as needed.

    - **Fingerprint Region (1500–500 cm⁻¹)** can be complex but may still offer **diagnostic peaks** for aromatic ring substituents or subtle structural features.
